## 1. Importance of Timely Delivery in Software Project Management

### Why is timely delivery crucial?
- Keeps clients happy by delivering software on time.  
- Helps the team move to other projects without delays.

### How can project managers ensure deadlines are met?
- Break the project into small tasks.  
- Set clear deadlines for each task.  
- Check progress often using tools like calendars or apps.  
- Adjust plans if tasks take longer than expected.

## 2. Effective Cost Control in Software Projects

### How does cost control contribute to success?
- Stops the project from running out of money.  
- Ensures resources are used wisely to finish the project.

### Strategies to prevent budget overruns:
- Estimate costs carefully at the start.  
- Track spending regularly.  
- Change plans if costs go up.  
- Find ways to save money without lowering quality.

## 3. Comparing Agile and Waterfall Methodologies

### Agile Methodology:
- Flexible, like building and adjusting as you go.  
- Work in short cycles (sprints).  
#### Advantages:
- Easy to adapt, gets feedback quickly.  
#### Disadvantages:
- Less structure, can be hard to manage.

### Waterfall Methodology:
- Step-by-step, like following a recipe.  
- Finish one phase before starting the next.  
#### Advantages:
- Clear plan, easy to follow.  
#### Disadvantages:
- Hard to change if something goes wrong.

## 4. When to Use Agile vs. Waterfall

### Agile is better for:
- Projects needing changes, like making a new app with user feedback.

### Waterfall is better for:
- Projects with fixed needs, like building a banking system with strict rules.

## 5. Ensuring Quality Assurance in Software Projects

### Methods for quality assurance:
- Test the software often (unit, integration, system tests).  
- Have team members check each otherâ€™s work.  
- Use tools to find errors automatically.

### Why maintain high standards?
- Makes software reliable and safe.  
- Keeps users happy and reduces fixes later.

## 6. Project Scope and Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

### How does defining project scope contribute to success?
- Sets clear goals for what the project will do.  
- Stops the project from growing too big or confusing.

### What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)?
- A way to split the project into small, easy tasks.  
- Helps plan, assign work, and track progress.

## 7. Benefits of a Detailed Project Schedule and Gantt Charts

### Benefits of a detailed schedule:
- Shows what tasks to do and when.  
- Helps use resources well.  
- Keeps the project on time.

### How Gantt charts assist:
- Visual tool showing tasks and timelines.  
- Helps see progress and spot delays easily.

## 8. Core Issues Addressed by the Software

### What problems does the software solve?
- Inefficiencies, like slow manual work or messy data.  
- Lack of automation, wasting time on repetitive tasks.

### Why are these problems significant?
- They cost time and money for users.  
- Solving them makes work faster and easier.

## 9. Importance of Clearly Defining the Problem

### How does it help?
- Helps the team understand exactly what to fix.  
- Leads to a solution that works for the real problem.

## 10. Describing the Software Solution Simply

### How to capture its essence:
- "Our software organizes tasks in one place and automates boring jobs, saving time."

## 11. Main Features That Make the Software Stand Out

### Key features:
- Easy-to-use interface.  
- Works with other tools.  
- Updates in real-time.  
- Gives smart insights with analytics.

## 12. Market Size and Growth Potential

### What data is available?
- Look at industry reports, competitor sales, and user surveys.  
- Shows how many people need the software and if demand is growing.

## 13. Using Market Trends to Inform Development

### How market trends help:
- Show what users want and what competitors offer.  
- Help add popular features or market the software better.
